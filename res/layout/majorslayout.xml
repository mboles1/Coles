			android:text="The objective of Accounting is to provide useful information for decision making. Accountants measure, interpret, and communicate information about organizations. They regularly work with and are a part of top management. People who get advice from accountants and who use their work include investors, creditors, company owners and managers, as well as the government. All business majors at KSU take two Accounting courses - Introduction to Financial Accounting and Introduction to Managerial Accounting. After completing these courses, students should have the basic understanding of Accounting necessary to support any business major. Upon graduating, Accounting Majors have a wide range of job options open to them. Many go into public accounting - where accounting firms provide independent auditing, accounting, tax, and consulting services to businesses and other clients. This is the traditional path for becoming a CPA - Certified Public Accountant. Others choose positions in specific companies - becoming managerial, tax, or financial accountants or internal auditors. Still others enter the specialized field of not-for-profit accounting. Coles College Accounting graduates have high CPA Exam pass rates. Accounting also serves as a solid background for graduate work in any business area or in law."></TextView>
